start creating player and then disconnect

start creating player but another client makes one first

create player in view of another client

login/disconnect from player in view of another client

move in/out of view of another client

player can't move in a cell with:
	- other players
	- more than 3 occuppied subcells

map.obj.g(loc).dewd_pck.unpack( map ,loc )

property for objects which can be both stackables and containers
	map.obj.o[loc][key]	=[ stack ,{ id :cnt }]

bags if empty can be near other items on ground;
	if not empty, moves other items away
	if full enough, doesn't allow player to pass

adding things must return how many things actually added

adding things can turn stacks into containers anywhere in the path
	that's why the given path must be updated to new path

added	=map.addstack_cnt([ loc ,"bigbag" ,0 ], new things.stack.Belt() )

bag.getcnt()





map.addthing( loc ,new things.Bigbag() )

map.obj.o[loc].bigbags

map.obj.g(loc).bigbag[0].inv.pithos[1].take( "belts" ,1 )

pl.inv.backpack
